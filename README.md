# Spotify Clone

*  This is a simple clone of the Spotify web player interface. I built it completely using HTML for the structure and CSS for all the styling and layout.

* The main goal was to create the look and feel of Spotify's design, including its side navigation, main content area with album/playlist cards, and the bottom playback bar.

* Important Note: This project is only about the visual design. It does not play music or have any working buttons or interactive features because it doesn't use JavaScript.
